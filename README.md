# iOS NetworkConnect Challenge

## Introduction

This sample is a swift project with a UIViewController created for you to start.

## Getting Started

The challenge for you is to fetch the Rick and Morty API

{
  "characters": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character",
  "locations": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location",
  "episodes": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode"
}

To fetch the first page of the characters and modify the app is needed to show in a list the name of the character and the image.
All of this in the background thread. Only when the network response is ready the work should return to the main thread to update the UI.

After the list is created, when a character is selected you should create a new view in which you must show the character photo, name, gender, species and origin name.

## Guidelines

* You should create the views programatically 
* The way you fetch the API it's up to you


## Deliverables

* [required] Please submit your solution in a PR from your own fork and branch
* [required] As an extra deliverable please submit a video link (or gif image) within your readme of the working app.
